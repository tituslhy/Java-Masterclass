# Local Classes

Local classes are inner classes declared directly in a code block, usually a method body.

**Therefore they have no access modifers!** These classes are only accessible in the method while it's executing.

Like an inner class, they have access to all fields and methods on the enclosing class.

They can also access local variables and method arguments that are final or effectively final.
