# Static Nested Class
The static nested class is a class enclosed in the structure of another class and declared as static.

This means the class, if accessed externally requires the outer class name as part of the qualifying name.

This class has the advantage of being able to access private attributes on the outer class.

The enclosing class can access **any attributes** on the static nested class, including private attributes.
