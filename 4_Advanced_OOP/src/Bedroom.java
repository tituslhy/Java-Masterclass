/*
 Create a class with the name Bedroom. This class contains eight member variables:

    name of type String;
    wall1, wall2, wall3, wall4 of type Wall;
    ceiling of type Ceiling;
    bed of type Bed, and
    lamp of type Lamp.

The class constructor should accept all eight of the member variables as parameters, and there should also be two
additional methods:
    getLamp() which returns an object of type Lamp, and
    makeBed() which prints a message that the bed is being made and also calls the make() method in the Bed class
