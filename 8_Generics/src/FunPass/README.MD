# üéüÔ∏è Assignment: The Generic Ticketing System

## Background:
You‚Äôve been asked to build a tiny ticketing system for a local events app called FunPass. The system sells tickets for different event types ‚Äî concerts, movies, and sports matches ‚Äî and each event type has its own extra data (e.g., performer name, movie rating, team names).

Your goal is to design a generic class that can handle all these different ticket types without duplicating code.

‚∏ª

## Requirements:
1.	Create a generic class Ticket<T>. It should store:
- a String ticketId
- a double price
- and an object of type T (the event details).
Example:
- Ticket<Concert> for concert tickets
- Ticket<Movie> for movie tickets
- Ticket<SportsMatch> for sports tickets
2.	Create three event classes:
- Concert with artistName and venue.
- Movie with title and rating.
- SportsMatch with teamA, teamB, and location.
3.	Create a method to print the ticket details.
- Use generics properly ‚Äî e.g., a method like void printTicketInfo() that can print all the data nicely.
4.	In your main method (or a demo class):
- Create a few tickets of different types (concert, movie, sports).
- Add them to a List<Ticket<?>>.
- Loop through and print all ticket info.
