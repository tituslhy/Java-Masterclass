# Ordered and Sorted Map implementations
The Map interface has the `LinkedHashMap` and `TreeMap` classes/

The `LinkedHashMap` is a key-value entry collection whose keys are ordered by **insertion order**.

The `TreeMap` is sorted **by its keys** so a key needs to implement `Comparable` or be initialized with a specific `Comparator`.
