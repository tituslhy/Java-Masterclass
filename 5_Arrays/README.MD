## Array

An array is a data structure storing a sequence of values - **all of the same type**

You can have arrays for any primitive type or any class.

Elements in an array are indexed, starting at 0.

The more common way is to declare it with type + square brackets + array name:
```
int[] integerArray;
```

The alternataive way is to define an array like this:
```
String courseList [];
```
